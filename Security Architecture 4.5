1. Firewall
Rules:
•	Regularly review and update firewall rules to ensure they are aligned with the current security policies.
•	Implement rule-based logging and alerts for suspicious activity.
Access Lists:
•	Use Access Control Lists (ACLs) to define and enforce which users and systems can access specific network resources.
•	Implement least privilege principle.
Ports/Protocols:
•	Close unnecessary ports and restrict protocols to reduce the attack surface.
•	Implement stateful inspection to monitor active connections.
Screened Subnets:
•	Use Demilitarized Zones (DMZs) to isolate public-facing services from the internal network.
•	Implement network segmentation to contain potential breaches.
2. IDS/IPS
Trends:
•	Analyze traffic trends to identify unusual patterns that could indicate an attack.
•	Use machine learning to enhance anomaly detection capabilities.
Signatures:
•	Regularly update signature databases to detect the latest threats.
•	Implement custom signatures for organization-specific threats.
3. Web Filter
Agent-based:
•	Deploy agents on endpoints to enforce web filtering policies even when users are off the corporate network.
Centralized Proxy:
•	Use a centralized proxy to monitor and control all web traffic.
•	Ensure SSL inspection is enabled for secure traffic.
URL Scanning:
•	Implement real-time URL scanning to block access to malicious sites.
Content Categorization:
•	Regularly update content categorization to adapt to new and emerging threats.
•	Use granular control to block specific categories that pose risks.
Block Rules:
•	Establish block rules for known malicious URLs and IP addresses.
•	Utilize threat intelligence feeds to keep block lists updated.
Reputation:
•	Integrate reputation-based filtering to block websites with poor reputations.
4. Operating System Security
Group Policy:
•	Use Group Policies to enforce security settings across all Windows machines.
•	Implement policies to control software installation and limit administrative privileges.
SELinux:
•	Enforce Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) policies on Linux servers to restrict access based on predefined rules.
5. Implementation of Secure Protocols
Protocol Selection:
•	Choose secure protocols like HTTPS, SSH, and SFTP over insecure ones.
•	Enforce the use of TLS for email and web communications.
Port Selection:
•	Use non-standard ports for services where feasible to reduce the risk of automated attacks.
Transport Method:
•	Implement VPNs for secure remote access.
•	Use encrypted communication channels for sensitive data.
6. DNS Filtering
•	Deploy DNS filtering to block access to malicious domains.
•	Use threat intelligence to enhance DNS filtering rules.
7. Email Security
DMARC:
•	Implement DMARC to prevent email spoofing.
•	Regularly monitor DMARC reports for unauthorized email activity.
DKIM:
•	Use DKIM to ensure the integrity of email messages.
•	Regularly rotate DKIM keys.
SPF:
•	Configure SPF records to define authorized email servers.
•	Monitor SPF records for any unauthorized changes.
Gateway:
•	Use secure email gateways to filter inbound and outbound email traffic.
•	Implement advanced threat protection to detect phishing and malware.
8. File Integrity Monitoring
•	Deploy file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to critical files.
•	Integrate with SIEM for real-time alerts and incident response.
9. Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
•	Implement DLP solutions to monitor and control the transfer of sensitive data.
•	Enforce policies to prevent data exfiltration through email, web, and removable media.
10. Network Access Control (NAC)
•	Use NAC to enforce security policies on devices attempting to connect to the network.
•	Implement health checks to ensure devices meet security requirements before granting access.
11. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)/Extended Detection and Response (XDR)
•	Deploy EDR solutions to detect and respond to threats on endpoints.
•	Use XDR to correlate data across multiple security layers for comprehensive threat detection.
12. User Behavior Analytics (UBA)
•	Implement UBA to monitor user activities and detect anomalies indicative of insider threats or compromised accounts.
•	Use machine learning to improve the accuracy of behavior-based detection.
